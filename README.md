I'm Dominic Zhang. I build Machine Learning models and data visualizations related to education and other public goods, and studying for my Master's in Computer Science at NYU Tandon. Previously 9-12 Math & Physics Teacher. I care about developing accessible and responsible technology and tools for social goods and improving the state of the world.
